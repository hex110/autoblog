## Explanation

As part of the [[Live machinery workshop]], I'm making an app exploring live interfaces / autostructures in blogging. Authors can just dump in their messy working notes, with maybe some 'prayers' about how they're displayed. Users describe themselves to the AI which then on the frontend side regenerates each note as the user views them, fit for the eyes for that person.

## Tech stack

Stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite. Anthropic API. React Context API. Demo version can be without server; Final version should def incoroporate backend.
