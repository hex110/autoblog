## Progress

- So far it's going pretty well, not too bad.
- Integrated the Anthropic API for personalized content generation; initial tests show promising results.
- Encountered some issues with the Markdown rendering, particularly with nested lists and tables.
- Implemented a custom hook to manage user context and preferences, which streamlined state management.
- The AI-generated content is sometimes too verbose; need to fine-tune the prompt for brevity.
- Added error handling for missing markdown files, which improved the app's resilience.
- Experimented with different React state management libraries, but decided to stick with Context API for simplicity.
- The toggle functionality between original and modified content is working well, but needs more user feedback.
- Performance optimization: lazy loading markdown files significantly reduced initial load times.
- User feedback indicates a need for more customization options in the AI-generated content.
- Planning to integrate a backend service to handle markdown processing and storage for better scalability.
