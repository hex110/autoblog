Many scholars think of [[Deliberative democracy]] as the ideal, but we are far from it. The modern version would look like [[Deliberative digital democracy]], but we are on course toward [[Liberal-individualist digital democracy]]: [[The liberal-individualist position on digital democracy has become the de facto default]].

My instinct is that deliberative democracy is more democratic and just, gives power to the people, as well as responsibility for growth and contemplation. Niki and I seem to agree that [[Deliberation can lead to moral progress]].

[[William MacAskill]] also finds this an important cause area. From [[Highlights - William_MacAskill's Quick Takes]]:
>By working on good deliberative processes, we could thereby improve decision-making on all the Grand Challenges we will face. This work could also help with AI safety, too: if we can guarantee power-sharing after the development of superintelligence, that decreases the incentive for competitors to race and cut corners on safety.

He calls this **the “meta” challenge of ensuring that we have good deliberative processes through the period of explosive growth**.

So, improving deliberative processes can lead to improved decision-making and better safety on "grand challenges", as well as making the world more just, and speeding up moral progress.
