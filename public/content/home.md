**Autoblog** is an experimental interface meant to help writers *publish their most authentic thoughts* and readers *make sense of those thoughts in their unique context*. Inspired by [Live machinery](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9KamjXbTaQpPnNsxp/live-machinery-interface-design-workshop-for-ai-safety-ea), Autoblog *scales that which used to not be scalable*; That is, nuance, context, and personalization.

This website (Autoblog Documentation) not only provides documentation for those interested in [[Getting started|forking Autoblog for their own use]], but also functions as a working demo, as it's running on top of Autoblog. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/sofvanh/autoblog).
