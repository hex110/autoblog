# Autoblog

**Autoblog** is an experimental interface meant to help writers *publish their most authentic thoughts* and readers *make sense of those thoughts in their unique context*. Inspired by [Live machinery](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9KamjXbTaQpPnNsxp/live-machinery-interface-design-workshop-for-ai-safety-ea), Autoblog *scales that which used to not be scalable*; That is, nuance, context, and personalization.

## Live demo!

I strongly recommend taking a look at the [live demo, doubling as project docs](https://autoblog-560282598197.europe-west1.run.app/).
